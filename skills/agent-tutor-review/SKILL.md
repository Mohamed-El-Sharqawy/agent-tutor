description: Spaced-repetition review sessions and retention tracking for subjects learned with the agent-tutor skill. Recall-first practice over lesson notes, adaptive FSRS-style interval scheduling (uncapped by default), honest retention verdicts, and a mixed mini-quiz per session. Use when the user wants to revise or practice old topics, check what they remember, or when the dashboard shows notes up for review.

# Agent Tutor — Review

Understanding decays. This skill runs recall-first review sessions and keeps the retention schedule honest.

**Vault root:** `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` env var, else `learning/` in the current workspace. All content under `<vault>/Learning/`.

## The schedule

Every lesson note carries a `review:` block in its frontmatter with the note's memory state:

```yaml
review:
  interval: 6      # current interval in days
  ease: 2.5        # multiplier applied on a solid recall
  due: 2026-08-28  # next review date
```

Scheduling is **FSRS-inspired and adaptive** — no fixed ladder and no ceiling. After each review, compute the next state:

| Verdict | Interval | Ease |
|---|---|---|
| **Solid** | `round(interval × ease)` | `+0.05`, up to `max_ease` |
| **Shaky but recoverable** | `round(interval × 1.2)` | `−0.2`, down to `min_ease` |
| **Gone** | reset to the initial interval | `−0.5`, down to `min_ease`; flag for re-study |

Defaults — overridable per learner with an optional `review_policy:` block in the learner profile:

```yaml
review_policy:
  scheduler: fsrs-inspired
  initial_interval: 1   # days after first learning / after a lapse
  ease: 2.5             # starting multiplier
  min_ease: 1.3
  max_ease: 3.5
  max_interval: null    # null = unbounded; set e.g. 365 to cap growth
  fuzz: true            # ±5% jitter on computed due dates so notes don't pile up on one day
```

Notes are never "done": a long interval just means the topic comes up rarely. Legacy notes whose `review:` field is a plain list (`[+1d, +3d, +7d]`) still work — take the last entry as the current interval with default ease, and migrate them to the block format at this review.

## Running a review session

1. Read the review queue from the dashboard:
   - **Markdown mode** (default): read `Learning/Dashboard.md` → **Up for review** section (notes whose next review date has passed).
   - **Html mode** (`output_format.dashboard: html` in the learner profile): read the `agent-tutor-state` JSON island at the top of `Learning/Dashboard.html`'s `<body>` — its `due_notes[]` entries (note, due date, interval) are the queue. Map each entry back to its actual note file under `Learning/<Subject>/notes/` (island labels are display names); the thin `Dashboard.md` hub is a signpost — never parse it.
   - If the dashboard looks stale in either mode, scan `Learning/<Subject>/notes/*/` frontmatter directly — note `review:` frontmatter is always the scheduling authority.
2. **Recall first, always.** For each note: ask the user to explain the topic from memory *before* showing anything. ("Explain closures to me as if I'd never heard of them.")
3. Judge the recall against the note's key takeaways, then apply the schedule table:
   - **Solid** → apply the solid row.
   - **Shaky but recoverable** → show the key takeaways, have them re-explain; apply the shaky row only if the second attempt is clean, otherwise treat as gone.
   - **Gone** → mark for re-study: re-open the lesson, re-teach the gaps, apply the gone row (reset to the initial interval).
4. **Interleave**: mix topics from different phases/subjects in one session — interleaving is the point, don't review one phase in isolation.
5. End with a **mixed mini-quiz** (5–8 questions spanning everything reviewed today).
   - If an interactive quiz tool is available (e.g. pi's `quiz`), use it.
   - Otherwise run a chat quiz: one question at a time, wait for the answer, explain why the right option is right, track the score, report pass/fail vs 70% at the end.
6. Update each note's `review:` frontmatter, the Dashboard review queue, and append a session log entry (type `review`) to `Learning/<Subject>/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with per-topic retention verdicts.

## Honesty rules

- Judge recall against the note's key takeaways, not against "close enough".
- Tell the user their actual retention state — "you've forgotten X entirely" is useful information.
- If more than half of a subject's notes fail review, say it plainly and propose a re-teach plan rather than patching holes.

## Dashboard maintenance

Keep the **Up for review** section current: one bullet per due note, sorted by due date:

```
- [[notes/03-closures]] — +7d interval, due 2026-08-24
```

Remove bullets after the review is logged. This list is what the tutor reads at session start, so it must be true.

**Html mode** (`output_format.dashboard: html` in the learner profile): the queue lives in `Dashboard.html` — the **Up for review** section and the `due_notes[]` of its `agent-tutor-state` island. Keep it true by regenerating the html dashboard whole at the end of the session (fresh island → pages → hub counters, the same update-the-Dashboard moment as any session end); never hand-patch the html, and never parse the thin `Dashboard.md` hub.
